# tree-do (Original Idea - July 2024)

This archive preserves the original spark that led to treedo.

## Original README (2024-07-19)

> Index all your pending tasks in a Kanban TUI: `.md`, `# todo:`

## Research Notes

[boards](https://github.com/benrutter/boards) just found it after I created the repo, literally what I intend to do, use the file-system, hence "tree"-do.

## Evolution

What started as an idea for indexing tasks in markdown files evolved into **treedo**: a complete task management system that treats your entire life as a task tree, with leaves synced wherever you need them.

The original "tree" metaphor (filesystem-based organization) became the core philosophy - but instead of just indexing existing tasks, treedo actively manages and synchronizes them across your entire digital workspace.
