# tdo Brand Identity

## Core Concept

**You are the root.** Everything else branches from you.

## Brand Values

### Organic Growth
Tasks aren't isolated items on a list — they're living branches of your life tree. They grow, interconnect, and bear fruit.

### Radical Simplicity
Plain text. Clear hierarchy. No friction between thought and action.

### Distributed by Design
Like a garden with multiple plots, your tasks live where they make sense — in project repos, personal folders, wherever you work.

## Visual Identity

### Typography
- **Monospace first**: We're a developer tool at heart
- Clean, readable fonts for documentation
- Unicode tree characters (╭─┬─╮) as visual signatures

### Colors
Drawing from garden imagery:
- **Primary**: Deep green (`#2d5016`) — growth, vitality
- **Accent**: Warm brown (`#8b4513`) — earth, roots, stability  
- **Background**: Soft cream (`#faf8f3`) — paper, organic
- **Text**: Rich black (`#1a1a1a`) — clarity, contrast

### Logo Concept

Keep it minimal:
- Simple wordmark: **tdo** in a clean monospace font
- For inline use: `[tdo]` or `·tdo·`
- Let the .garden domain do the visual work

The best logo is no logo — just consistent, clean typography.

## Voice & Tone

### Principles
- **Clear over clever**: Documentation that respects your time
- **Humble confidence**: Powerful without being overwhelming
- **Human scale**: Built for individuals, not enterprises

### Examples
- ✅ "Edit any leaf, your whole tree updates"
- ❌ "Synergize your workflow with revolutionary task paradigms"

## Usage Guidelines

### The Name
- Always lowercase: **tdo**
- Pronunciation: "tee-doo" or "tree-do"
- In sentences: "Use tdo to manage your task tree"
- Domain always includes TLD: "Visit tdo.garden"

### The Metaphor
Lean into the tree/garden imagery when it clarifies, but don't force it:
- ✅ "Your tasks branch naturally from life areas"
- ⚠️ "Prune your task foliage for maximum yield" (too much)

### Command Line
```bash
$ tdo init      # Plant your tree
$ tdo sync      # Update all branches
$ tdo status    # Check your garden
```

## Future Considerations

As tdo grows, the brand can extend naturally:
- `tdo cloud` — Backup and sync service
- `tdo teams` — Shared gardens for collaboration
- Community: "gardeners" who tend their task trees
